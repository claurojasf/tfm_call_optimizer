Agent: Hi, Mark, this is Jason from Legal Recovery Associates. You have an unpaid balance of $950.
Client: I know, but I can’t pay now.
Agent: We might need to take legal action.
Client: Can I do a partial payment?
Agent: Yes, $200 today would help.
Client: I can do $250.
Agent: I’ll note that and put a hold on legal proceedings.
