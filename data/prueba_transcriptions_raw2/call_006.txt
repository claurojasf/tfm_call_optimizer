Agent: Good morning, this is Susan from Debt Recovery Services. You have a $1,200 balance.
Client: I can’t afford that much.
Agent: We can settle for a one-time payment of $800.
Client: That’s still high. Can you go lower?
Agent: The lowest we can offer is $750.
Client: Okay, I can do that.
Agent: Great! I’ll process the payment now.
