Agent: Hi, this is Lisa from Finance Assist. I see a balance of $750 on your account.
Client: I can’t pay the full amount right now. What are my options?
Agent: We can set up three monthly payments of $250 each.
Client: That’s still too high. Can we do four instead?
Agent: Let me check… Yes, we can do four installments of $187.50. Would that work?
Client: That’s better. When do I have to start?
Agent: The first payment would be due in two weeks.
Client: I might need until next month.
Agent: If we extend the first payment by a month, there would be a small interest charge.
Client: How much?
Agent: About $5 per month.
Client: That’s not too bad. Let’s do it.
Agent: I’ll send the agreement now.
